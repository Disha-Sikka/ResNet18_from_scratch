# ResNet18_from_scratch in Pytorch

This project contains a simple and clean implementation of **ResNet-18** from scratch using **PyTorch**. It defines the basic building block (residual block) and stacks them to build the full architecture.

---

## Structure

- `BasicBlock`: A simple residual block with two Conv2D layers and a skip connection.
- `ResNet`: The full ResNet-18 architecture.
- `resnet18()`: A helper function to create a ResNet-18 model instance.
